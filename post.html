                The de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum is a treatise on the theory of Ethics. It expounds and criticizes the
                three ethicalsystems most prominent in Cicero’s day, the Epicurean, the Stoic and that of the Academy
                under Antiochus. The most elaborate of Cicero’s philosophical writings, it has had fewer readers than
                his less technical essays on
                moral subjects. But it is of importance to the student of philosophy as the only systematic account
                surviving from
                antiquity of those rules of life which divided the allegiance of thoughtful men during the centuries
                when the old religions
                had lost their hold and Christianity had not yet emerged. And the topics that it handles can never lose
                their interest.
                The title ‘About the Ends of Goods and Evils’ requires explanation. It was Aristotle who put the ethical
                problem in the form of the question, What is the T𝜆o or End, the supreme end of man’s endeavour, in the
                attainment
                of which his Good or Well-being lies? For Aristotle, Telos connoted not only ‘aim,’ but ‘completion’;
                and he found
                the answer this question in the complete development and right exercise of the faculties of man’s
                nature, and
                particularly of this distinctively human faculty of Reason. The life of the Intellect was the Best, the
                Chief Good; and
                lesser Goods were Means to the attainment of this End. Thus was introduced the notion of an ascending
                scale of Goods, and
                this affected the interpretation of the term Telos. Telos came to be understood as denoting not so much
                the end or aim
                of endeavour as the end or extreme point of a series, the topmost good. To this was naturally opposed an
                extreme of
                minus value, the topmost, or rather bottommost, evil. Hence arose the expressions 𝜏𝜆o 𝛾𝛼𝜃𝜈, 𝜏𝜆o
                𝜅𝛼𝜅𝜈,
                ‘End of Goods, of Evils,’ which occur in Philodemus, Rhetoric I, 218.8 ff. (Südhans), and are translated
                by Cicero finis bonorum
                et malorum. As a title for his book he throws this phrase into the plural, meaning ‘different views as
                to the Chief
                Good and Evil.’1 Hence in title and to some extent in method, the de Finibus may be compared with such
                modern works as
                Martineau’s Types of Ethical Theory and Sidgwick’s Methods of Ethics
            </p>
            <p>Cicero belongs to a type not unknown in English life, that of the statesman who is also a student and a
                writer. From
                his youth he aspired to play a part in public affairs, and the first step towards this ambition was to
                learn to speak. He
                approached Greek philosophy as part of a liberal education for a political career, and he looked on it
                as supplying
                themes for practice in oratory. But his real interest in it went deeper; the study of it formed his mind
                and humanized
                his character, and he loved it to the end of his life.

            <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
            <p>In his youth he heard the heads of the three chief Schools of Athens, Phaedrus the Epicurean, Diodotus
                the Stoic,
                and Philo the Academic, who had come to Rome to escape the disturbances of the Mithradatic War. When
                already
                launched in public life, he withdrew, at the age of 27 (79 B.C.), to devote two more years to philosophy
                and rhetoric.
                Six months were spent at Athens, and the introduction to de Finibus Book V gives a brilliant picture of
                his student
                life there with his friends. No passage more vividly displays what Athens and her memories meant to the
                cultivated
                Roman. At Athens Cicero attended the lectures of the Epicurean Zeno and the Academic Antiochus. Passing
                on to
                Rhodes to work under the leading professors of rhetoric, he there met Posidonius, the most renowned
                Stoic of the day.
                He returned to Rome to plunge into his career as advocate and statesman; but his Letters show him
                continuing his
                studies in his intervals of leisure. For many years the Stoic Diodotus was an inmate of his house.
                Under the Triumvirate, as his influence in politics waned, Cicero turned more and more to literature.
                His earliest essay
                in rhetoric, the de Inventione, had appeared before he was twenty-five; but his first considerable works
                on rhetoric and
                on political science, the de Oratore, de Republica, and de Legibus, were written after his return from
                exile in 57. The
                opening pages of de Finibus Book III give a glimpse of his studies at this period. In 51 he went as
                Governor to Cilicia;
                and he wrote no more until the defeat of Pompey at Pharsalus had destroyed his hopes for the Republic.
                After his reconciliation with Caesar and return to Rome in the autumn of 46, Cicero resumed writing on
                rhetoric. In
                February 45 came the death of his beloved daughter Tullia, followed soon after by the final downfall of
                the Pompeians
                at Munda. Crushed by public and private sorrow, he shut himself up in one of his country houses and
                sought distraction
                in unremitting literary work. He conceived the idea, as he implies in the preface to de Finibus, of
                rendering a last
                service to his country by bringing the treasures of Greek thought within the reach of the Roman public.
                Both his
                Academica and de Finibus were compiled in the following summer; the latter was probably presented to
                Brutus, to
                whom it is dedicated on his visit to Cicero in August 45 (ad Att. XIII.44). Seven months later Brutus
                was one of the
                assassins of Caesar. In the autumn of 44 Cicero flung himself again into the arena with his attack on
                Antony, which
                led to his proscription and death in December 43</p>
            <h2>Section 1.2</h2>
            <p>Excepting the de Oratore, de Republica and de Legibus, the whole of Cicero’s most important writings on
                philosophy
                and rhetoric belong to 46-44 B.C. and were achieved within two years. Such a mass of work so rapidly
                produced could
                hardly be original, and in fact it made no claim to be so. It was designed as a sort of encyclopaedia of
                philosophy
                for Roman readers. Cicero’s plan was to take each chief department of thought in turn, and present the
                theories of
                the leading schools upon it, appending to each theory the criticisms of its opponents. Nor had his work
                that degree
                of independence which consists in assimilating the thought of others and recasting it in the mould of
                the writer’s own
                mind. He merely chose some recent hand-book on each side of the question under consideration, and
                reproduced it in
                Latin, encasing passages of continuous exposition in a frame of dialogue, and adding illustrations from
                Roman history
                and poetry. He puts the matter frankly in a letter to Atticus (XII.52): “You will say, ‘What is your
                method in such
                compositions?’ They are mere transcripts, and cost comparatively little labour; I only supply the words,
                of which I
                have a copious flow.” In De Finibus (I.6) he rates his work a little higher, not without justice, and
                claims to be the critic
                as well as the interpreter of his authorities.
                This method of writing was consonant with Cicero’s own position in philosophy. Since his early studies
                under Philo
                he had been a professed adherent of the New Academy, and as such maintained a sceptical attitude on
                questions
                of knowledge. On morals he was more positive; though without a logical basis for his principles, he
                accepted the
                verdict of the common moral conscience of his age and country. Epicureanism he abhorred as demoralizing.
                The
                Stoics repelled him by their harshness and narrowness, but attracted him by their strict morality and
                lofty theology.
                His competence for the task of interpreting Greek thought to Rome was of a qualified order. He had read
                much, and
                had heard the chief teachers of the day. But with learning and enthusiasm he combined neither depth of
                insight nor
                scientific precision. Yet his services to philosophy must not be underrated. He introduced a novel style
                of exposition,
                copious, eloquent, impartial and urbane; and he created a philosophical terminology in Latin which has
                passed into
                the languages of modern Europe</p>
